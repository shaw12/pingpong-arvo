## How to Run the application

- When you will open the application the Screen appears on which you have to write the Two Player names to move forward.

- After writing names on clicking `Continue` button, if the form  validates then it'll navigate to other screen otherwise it will show error.

- At second screen you can increase the value of win by simply click on `Add Win` and can change result.

- The result of current Winner and the win difference appear on the bottom of same screen.



### In future, I would like to add new improvements like:-

- After Player Inputs Screen, I want to display a screen which contains any game like scissor paper rock game or Tick Tak Toe. 

- So, the result appears on the basis of their wins.

- At second(Tracking) screen, on hitting reload it holds the current values.

- Improve UI.
